# SpeedrunRecordsParser
Parses the JSON records of [SpeedRunIGT](https://github.com/RedLime/SpeedRunIGT) and displays them as a decent website.

Uses PHP and [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) in dark mode.

Currently showing all runs with an `enter_end` time.

To use, copy the file `config.example.php` to `config.php` and change the path. Uses `/home/username/speedrunigt/` by default.
